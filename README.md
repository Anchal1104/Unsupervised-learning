# Unsupervised-learning
 Techniques to extract meaningful patterns and insights from unlabeled datasets. Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model learns from input data without labeled responses. It is widely used for clustering, dimensionality reduction, anomaly detection, and data visualization.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
- Explore and analyze datasets without predefined labels.
- Apply algorithms like *K-Means Clustering, **Hierarchical Clustering, **Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
- Visualize data patterns and group similar data points.
- Understand hidden structures and gain actionable insights.
